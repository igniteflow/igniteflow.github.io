One of my motivations to get into programming in the first place was to have a job that wasn't bound by location.  I'd long had a dream of working from a beach hut in the day, perhaps a quick spearfish session at lunch or a nap under a palm tree, something akin to Lister's dreams of Fiji.  However, this never really materialised, or let's just say it got put on hold.</p>\n<p>What I'm trying to say is there wasn't any great driver to finally take the plunge and go remote.  If anything I was more than content with my life in London.  I had good friends, more hobbies than I had time for, a beautiful run commute to work through Regent's Park and Primrose Hill and a great work environment with free lunches, a pool table and most excellent co-workers.  Maybe that's how it is sometimes, we expect big events to be the catalyst for change, but sometimes it's just scratching an itch.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let's get into the practicalities.  After making the decision, and more importantly announcing it to friends and family, I was now committed.  Now came the storm before the calm.  </p>\n<h2>Preperation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you research.  If you are not native to the country you will be going to, read as much as you can about the place.  Knowing the basics of the geography, culture and weather will help you make better decisions. Don't be afraid to ask questions on online forums, there is a wealth of information available, learn from other's mistakes not your own.</li>\n<li>Flights.  Google Flights and Skyscanner were really useful here.  Worth searching a week before and after your intended departure date to see if there are any price drops.</li>\n<li>My things.  Any illusions of being a minimalist quikly evapourated when I had to fit everything I owned into a storage unit.  It took longer than I thought to pack up my flat and I wish I had started sooner.  Small tip - I got an UberXL to take the 4-5 boxes I had to the storage depot for a fraction of the price of a van.</li>\n<li>Visas.  Check the visa requirements for the country or countries you are going to.  Give yourself enough time to deal with the bureaucracy. </li>\n<li>Shots.  Tell your doctor about your travel plans so that you get any required immunisations.  Don't leave this until the last minute as some shots require a week or so to offer full protection.</li>\n<li>Banking.  At the very least take a debit and a credit card.  Ideally take two or more debit cards.  Why?  If you only take one debit card and lose it, you might have to withdraw cash from ATMs with a credit card and pay dearly with interest.  From my experience I would recommend <a href=\"https://monzo.com/\">Monzo</a> and <a href=\"https://transferwise.com/\">Transferwise</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>What to pack.  This is always going to differ person-to-person and by location.  Some items I found useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fabric compartments to help organise your suitcase.</li>\n<li>Swimwear, googles, snorkel and mask  </li>\n<li>Multitool.  Not all AirBnbs/hotels provide adequate knives, bottle openers etc.</li>\n<li>Sun lotion.  This is an item that always seems to have a big markup when buying on location, so buy in bulk at home to save a few pennies</li>\n<li>Waterproofs.  A mac and something to keep your phone/wallet dry.</li>\n<li>Footwear.  If your shoes resemble canoes like me, choose your footwear wisely as they will likely be the biggest space stealers in your suitcase.</li>\n<li>Noise cancelling headphones and earplugs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Life on the other side</h2>\n<p>My first month of travel took me to Borneo, Kuala Lumpar, Cebu, Taiwan and Phuket.  Although this looked great on paper, by the time I reached Phuket I was exhausted and vowed that the next place I went I was going to spend at least two we</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}
