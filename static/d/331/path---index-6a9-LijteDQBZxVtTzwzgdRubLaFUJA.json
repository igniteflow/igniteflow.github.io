One of my motivations to get into programming in the first place was to have a job that wasn't bound by location.  I'd long had a dream of working from a beach hut in the day, perhaps a quick spearfish session at lunch or a nap under a palm tree, something akin to Lister's dreams of Fiji.  However, this never really materialised, or let's just say it got put on hold.</p>\n<p>What I'm trying to say is there wasn't any great driver to finally take the plunge and go remote.  If anything I was more than content with my life in London.  I had good friends, more hobbies than I had time for, a beautiful run commute to work through Regent's Park and Primrose Hill and a great work environment with free lunches, a pool table and most excellent co-workers.  Maybe that's how it is sometimes, we expect big events to be the catalyst for change, but sometimes it's just scratching an itch.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let's get into the practicalities.  After making the decision, and more importantly announcing it to friends and family, I was now committed.  Now came the storm before the calm.  </p>\n<h2>Preperation</h2>\n<p>So I've skipped the part about choosing a destination.  After realising the world was a very large place and having a few sleepness nights about where I should go, I whittled it down to two locations; Costa Rica or Thailand.  I say whittled, but really it was a fairly simple decision.  The previous year I had my sights set on Berlin, but now I wanted something further afield.  Central America or South-East Asia fitted by beach hut fuelled dream so the game was on.  Work timezones made the decision for me - working UK hours was ruled out Costa Rica so Thailand it was.</p>\n<p>Back to the preperation.  The tasks were quite straight-forward; buy a plane ticket, check out of my flat and move my things into storage, book accomodation at the destination.  Of course, life is never that simple.  </p>\n<p>Two things to do here; put your current life on pause and prepare for the new life you are about to embark on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flights</li>\n<li>My stuff.  As I was going away for two months and London rents are expensive, I decided to move out of my flat and put my things in storage.  My illusions of a minimal existence where quickly exitinguished when I had to pack up my things.  </li>\n<li>As my options for free store where a long way from London, I decided to just get a storage unit.  This works out at £90 a month.  As it month passes I struggle to remember what is in there</li>\n</ul>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}
